# Contributing

## Workflow

  1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project
  2. Clone your fork to your local machine (`git clone git@githhub.com:<username>/<project>.git`).
  3. Create a [topic branch](https://help.github.com/articles/branching-out/#branches) to contain your change
  4. Do development / make commits on your topic branch
  5. Ensure your changes pass testing (`npm test`)
  6. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) from your topic branch to this repository.
